Array:-
	Array is used to store multiple values of similar data types in a single reference or variable.
	Array is an index based one.
	Index starts with 0 and ends with n-1, when length of an array is n
	Array is fixed in size

Syntax   data type ref[] = new datatype [size];
Example int num[] = new int[5];


		10		20		30		40		55
Pos		0		1		2		3		4			
	  Num[0]  	    num[1]      num[2] 	    num[3] 	    num[4]



int num[] ={20, 40, 50, 60, 70};
String s[] = {“Saranya”, “Praveen”, “Sundar”,”Vignesh”};

Array disadvantage:
It accept only similar data type
Memory wastage is high in Array, because, Memory allocated in compile time


Enhanced for loop:
	Syntax – for(datatype new refName : value stored variable){
		   Sysout(new Ref Name)
				}


Normal Loop								Enhanced loop
Works based on index						based on value
Able to apply condition						can’t able to apply condition
Able to set the limit of execution				unable to set the limit of execution
Print in forward and reverse order				print only in forward order
Chance of exception						no chance of exception

For (int i=2;i<6;i++){						for(int i: a){
Logic									logic
}	 									}
