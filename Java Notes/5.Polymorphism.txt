Polymorphism
-Task implemented in many ways / Executing methods in more than one forms
Poly – Many
Morphism – forms
Types 
1.Method Overloading (Compile time)
2.Method Over ridding (Run Time)
 
1.Method Overloading (Compile time polymorphism):
	Decision of which methods to be call
Same Class
Same method name
Different arguments -------> 1. Based on Data Type
			   	     2. Based on datatype count
			 		3. Based on Datatype order	

2. Method Over ridding (Run time Polymorphism):
	Whenever the parent logic is not feasible, we have to override the same method
with same arguments in another class and we can change the logic.

Different Class
Same method
Same arguments
