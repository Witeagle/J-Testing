Scanner – Predefined Class
  used to Get the input from the user at the run time
  It is present in java.util package –
  If we need to use Scanner class properties we need to import java.util package.
Syntax:
	Scanners ObjName = new Scanner (System.in); 
	ObjName.methodName();

Scanner Methods:
nextByte();
nextShort();
nextInt();
nextLong();
nextFloat();
nextDouble();
nextBoolean();



To get String Value:

next(); - It will ignore after the space values
nextLine(); - It will accept Space


To get the single character – next().charAt(0);
We need to use nextLine(); method 1st and next(); method 2nd to get the String Input
If we used next(); method 1st nextLine(); method 2nd will get errors
In this case we have to create another separate object reference to nextLine(); method will call that method using separate object
