Features of JAVA:
1. Simple programming Language
2. Easy to Run and Debug (Error finding /Rectification) 
3. Free ware, Open source (Source code is available in web, anyone can make use of it)
4. Platform Independent – Single code written is capable of running in all the OS
5. Multithreading – We can able to run Multiple application at a time -- Parallel Execution
6. Portable 
7. More secure 


JDK – Java Development Kit
(Whenever I want to develop or run a program in Java, JDK is essential)
JDK – JRE+JRM
JRE – Java Run time environment - It contain Pre defined files and library
JVM – Java Virtual Machine  It is used for memory allocation

Tools: -  (IDE- Integrated Development Environment)
Notepad – Time consumption will be High
Eclipse – User friendly and free tool
Jdeveloper – Oracle – Paid tool
RAD - IBM



OOPS – Object Oriented Programming Structure:
Java – OOPS follows programming language.

OOPS – It is a method of implementation in which program is organized as collection of Objects, Class and Methods.
1. Object
2. Method
3. Class
4. Inheritance 
5. Abstraction
6. Polymorphism
7. Encapsulation


Project -> Package -> Class -> Method -> Object
Project – Collection of Package
Package – Collection of Classes
Class – Collection of methods, Variables and Objects
Method – Set of actions / Logics will be performed 
Object – It is used to call method, Run time memory allocation
